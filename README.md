Android Exam Project



We plan to build a crypto application where you can track the latest news, simulate your portfolio holdings and see the latest crypto prices and updates. 
The news tab will display article headlines that will link to the full article - for those who wish to learn more about a specific headline. 
User can see his total crypto portfolio net worth in the portfolio holdings tab, and he can add crypto holdings - select a cryptocurrency from the
list and enter the amount. Last but not least, each cryptocurrency's price can be seen in real-time.
